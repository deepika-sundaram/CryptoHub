1. Project Overview

Objective: To build a comprehensive cryptocurrency dashboard that provides real-time data on cryptocurrencies, including market prices, exchange information, news, blogs, and detailed cryptocurrency insights.
Target Audience: Crypto enthusiasts, investors, analysts, and traders seeking up-to-date information on the global cryptocurrency market.
2. Functional Requirements
2.1. Dashboard Overview
Display a summary of major cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) with key statistics like price, market capitalization, volume, and percentage change.
Provide a global market overview with total market capitalization and overall market performance.
Include real-time price tracking of cryptocurrencies.
2.2. Cryptocurrency Listings
List all available cryptocurrencies with the following information:
Current price (in USD and other major fiat currencies)
Market capitalization
24-hour trading volume
Percentage change in price over time (24h, 7d, 30d)
Allow users to sort and filter cryptocurrencies by different metrics (e.g., price, market cap, volume).
2.3. Cryptocurrency Details
For each cryptocurrency, provide detailed information including:
Historical price charts (using Chart.js)
Description and overview of the currency (e.g., its purpose, founders, and technology)
All-time high, all-time low prices
Links to the official website, whitepaper, and relevant social media.
Exchange availability: List of exchanges where the cryptocurrency is traded along with volume and liquidity data.
2.4. News & Blogs Integration
Aggregate and display the latest news articles from reliable sources (via RapidAPI or other news APIs).
Include blogs and opinion pieces relevant to the cryptocurrency market.
Users should be able to filter news by cryptocurrency or topic (e.g., market analysis, regulations, technological updates).
2.5. Exchange Listings
Provide a list of cryptocurrency exchanges with:
Current trading pairs
Trading fees
24-hour trading volume
Supported cryptocurrencies
Link to the exchange website
Allow users to compare exchanges based on trading volume, supported currencies, and fees.
2.6. User Authentication (Optional)
Allow users to sign up and log in to personalize their experience.
Provide a “Watchlist” feature for logged-in users to track favorite cryptocurrencies.
Enable email notifications for significant price changes, market news, or blog updates for tracked currencies.
2.7. Search and Filter
Implement a global search function to find specific cryptocurrencies, news, blogs, and exchanges.
Provide advanced filtering options by price, market cap, trading volume, and more.
2.8. Data Refresh and Real-Time Updates
Ensure that the application fetches real-time data through APIs and refreshes the dashboard at regular intervals (e.g., every 30 seconds for price updates).
Use WebSockets for real-time price updates where possible.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
3.1. Performance
The application should load within 3 seconds for all users.
Ensure seamless real-time data updates with minimal latency.
Handle at least 1,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
3.2. Security
Implement HTTPS for all data transmission.
Ensure API keys and other sensitive data are securely stored (e.g., using environment variables).
For authenticated users, use JWT (JSON Web Token) for session management.
3.3. Usability
The user interface must be intuitive and easy to navigate for both novice and advanced users.
Ensure the design is responsive and works smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
3.4. Availability
The application should have 99.9% uptime.
Use a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure) for deployment to ensure scalability and reliability.
3.5. Scalability
The system should be designed to handle growing numbers of users and increasing amounts of cryptocurrency data.
Utilize horizontal scaling to manage traffic spikes (e.g., during major market events).
4. Technical Requirements
4.1. Frontend
Framework: React.js
State Management: Redux Toolkit
UI Framework: Ant Design for creating the user interface components.
Charts: Chart.js for visualizing cryptocurrency trends and price data.
Real-Time Data: WebSockets for live cryptocurrency price updates.
API Calls: Axios (or Fetch API) to handle API requests.
4.2. Backend
Framework: Node.js with Express.
Database: PostgreSQL for storing user data (watchlists, authentication).
Data Fetching: Integrate with RapidAPI for fetching cryptocurrency prices, market data, news, and blogs.
Real-Time Updates: Use WebSockets to push price updates to the frontend in real-time.
4.3. Security
Authentication: JWT-based authentication for user login and session management (if user accounts are implemented).
Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data such as user credentials.
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on API calls to prevent abuse.
4.4. Hosting and Deployment
Cloud Platform: AWS for hosting the application.
Continuous Deployment: Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or Jenkins.
Containerization: Use Docker for containerizing the application for easier deployment and scaling.
